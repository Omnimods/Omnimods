[technology-description]
compression-initial=Sudden advances in technology allow you to compress and pack items in a more efficient manner. Once this is researched compressed versions of all recipes will appear for all techs already researched and for all future techs.
compression-mining=With greater understanding of molecular-spatial interactions it is now possible to replace ore fields with their compressed versions. Will unlock the compression planner shortcut which will compress selected ore patches.
compression-recipes=Great leaps in compressionology has made it possible to used compressed items directly to produce even more compressed stuff directly. Will unlock all recipes that uses compressed items
compression-compact-buildings=By studying how dwarves are so compact we found out how to put things more compact and now can compress buildings. Will unlock Compact building recipes.
compression-nanite-buildings=Some talked about tiny robots called nanites, so after hammering on robots long enough we made them really tiny. Will unlock Nanite building recipes.
compression-quantum-buildings=Some blokes named Bohr and Schrödinger talked about quantum so we copied it, once we finished reading their papers. Will unlock quantum building recipes.
compression-singularity-buildings=Einstein was onto blackholes, Singularities, why not make it that tiny now? Will unlock singularity building recipes.
compression-hand=Nothing up your sleeve! But now there is a stack in your pocket!

[mod-setting-name]
omnicompression_one_list=Compression recipe category.
omnicompression_building_levels=Building Compression stages.
omnicompression_multiplier=Building compression rate.
omnicompression_final_building=Highest tier only compression.
omnicompression_too_long_time=Time overload setting.
omnicompression_compensate_stacksizes=Compensate stack sizes.
omnicompression_normalize_stacked_buildings=Normalize stacked buildings.
omnicompression_compressed_tech_min=Minimal compression tech cost.
omnicompression_always_compress_sp=Always compress science packs.
omnicompression_1x1_buildings=1x1 tile sized compressors.
omnicompression_energy_mult=Compressed building energy usage multiplier.
omnicompression_cost_mult=Compressed building material cost multiplier.
omnicompression_hide_handcraft=Hide compressed recipes from handcraft.

[mod-setting-description]
omnicompression_one_list=Puts all the recipes based on compressed items into a seperate category, so they do not clutter the rest.
omnicompression_building_levels=The amount of times a building can be compressed, 1 through 4.
omnicompression_multiplier=How many non-compressed buildings does a compressed building contain. 1 through 10.
omnicompression_final_building=If checked, it will only compress the highest tier building.
omnicompression_too_long_time=When a technology takes longer than the time in the dialogue box, it will be ignored until you increase your research capacity.
omnicompression_compensate_stacksizes=Changes the base compression maths to prevent odd rounding in fluid based items such as barrels. /n if your recipes are too expensive, try changing this setting.
omnicompression_normalize_stacked_buildings=Normalize stacked buildings.
omnicompression_compressed_tech_min=Add a compression tech for costs above this regardless of other settings. (default is 2000, to align with vanilla space-science)
omnicompression_always_compress_sp=Put the names of the science packs that you always want to compress in the dialogue box.
omnicompression_1x1_buildings=Resizes the autocompressor, concentrator and condensator to 1x1 tiles from 3x3.\n[color=red]Changing this setting on an existing save may break your production lines![/color]
omnicompression_energy_mult=Compressed buildings will use energy*multiplier*compression rate instead of energy*compression rate
omnicompression_cost_mult=Compressed buildings will take compression rate * cost multiplier to build.\ni.e. At a compression rate of 2 and a cost multiplier of 2, a compact solar panel worth 2 regular panels will take 4 panels to build.
