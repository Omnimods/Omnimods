[mod-setting-description]
omnimatter-infinite-omnic-acid=If enabled, infinite omnite will require omnic acid to be mined
omnimatter-max-tier=Sets the max tier of omnitractors. Can be between 3 and 8.
omnimatter-pure-lvl-per-tier=Sets the number of pure extraction techs for each ore between each omnitractor tier. Can be between 2 and 6.
omnimatter-impure-lvls=Sets the number of impure extraction techs for each ore. Can be between 2 and 6.
omnimatter-fluid-lvl-per-tier=Sets the number of fluid extraction techs for each fluid between each omnitractor tier. Can be between 1 and 3.
omnimatter-fluid-lvl=Sets the number of fluid extraction techs required to reach maximum efficiency.(Sets the max amount of fluid level techs!) Can be between 2 and 10.
omnimatter-pure-tech-tier-cost-increase=Pure extraction technologies increase by this power for each increase in tier.
omnimatter-pure-tech-level-cost-increase=Determines how quickly the cost of tech levels increase. Warning, this is cumulative and therefore very sensitive, especially with many techs.
omnimatter-beginner-multiplier=Early Tech Cost Multiplier: Multiply all techs prior to "Electric Omnitractor 1" by this value. An amount smaller than 1 will make these techs cheaper. Range: 0.2 to 5
omnimatter-linear-science-packs=True: science pack cost scales linearly. False: science pack cost scales exponentially.
omnimatter-rocket-locked=The rocket silo will be locked behind all extraction technologies.
omnimatter-science-pack-constant=Determines the science pack costs of sciences as it goes up, lower bound is 0 for linear and 1 for non-linear.
omnimatter-fluid-processing=Makes the extraction recipe require whatever fluid the ore originally would have needed to mine.
