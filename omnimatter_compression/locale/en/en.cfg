[technology-description]
compression-initial=Sudden advances in technology allow you to compress and pack items in a more efficient manner. Once this is researched compressed versions of all recipes will appear for all techs already researched and for all future techs.
compression-mining=With greater understanding of molecular-spatial interactions it is now possible to compress ores on site.
compression-recipes=Great leaps in compressionology has made it possible to used compressed items directly to produce even more compressed stuff directly. Will unlock all recipes that uses compressed items
compression-compact-buildings=By studying how dwarves are so compact we found out how to put things more compact and now can compress buildings. Will unlock Compact building recipes.
compression-nanite-buildings=Some talked about tiny robots called nanites, so after hammering on robots long enough we made them really tiny. Will unlock Nanite building recipes.
compression-quantum-buildings=Some blokes named Bohr and Schrödinger talked about quantum so we copied it, once we finished reading their papers. Will unlock quantum building recipes.
compression-singularity-buildings=Einstein was onto blackholes, Singularities, why not make it that tiny now? Will unlock singularity building recipes.
compression-hand=Nothing up your sleeve! But now there is a stack in your pocket!
