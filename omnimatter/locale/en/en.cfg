[mod-setting-description]
omnimatter-infinite=Decides wether or not the world will generate infinite omnite ore patches.
omnimatter-infinite-omnic-acid=If enabled, infinite omnite ore patches will require omnic acid to be mined
omnimatter-max-tier=This sets the max tier of omnitractors, must be greater than or equal to 3.
omnimatter-pure-lvl-per-tier=How many tiers are there between every tier of omnitractors? Can be between 1 and 6, total number of techs is thrice this.
omnimatter-tier-pure-dependency=At this level of pure tech the next tier of omnitractor is researchable.
omnimatter-impure-lvl-per-tier=How many techs of impure extraction does it exist for each ore? Can be between 1 and 5.
omnimatter-tier-impure-dependency=At this level of impure tech the next tier of omnitractor is researchable.
omnimatter-fluid-lvl-per-tier=Decides how many levels of fluid there is within each tier.
omnimatter-fluid-lvl=This determines the number of fluid techs required to reach maximum efficiency for each omni-fluid. Make this number larger to increase the number of techs available to research. Range: 2-10
omnimatter-fluid-dependency=You must research this number of fluid techs prior to researching the next level Omnitractor tech. A larger number will require more techs to be researched prior to the next Omnitractor tech. Range:1 to fluid levels per tier.
omnimatter-pure-tech-tier-cost-increase=Pure extraction technologies increase by this power for each increase in tier.
omnimatter-pure-tech-level-cost-increase=Determines how quickly the cost of tech levels increase. Warning, this is cumulative and therefore very sensitive, especially with many techs.
omnimatter-beginner-multiplier=Early Tech Cost Multiplier: Multiply all techs prior to "Electric Omnitractor 1" by this value. An amount smaller than 1 will make these techs cheaper. Range: 0.2 to 5
omnimatter-linear-science-packs=Do you want to increase science pack cost linearly or exponentially?
omnimatter-rocket-locked=Do you have to research all extractions all the way to get rocket silo?
omnimatter-science-pack-constant=Determines the science pack costs of sciences as it goes up, lower bound is 0 for linear and 1 for non-linear.
